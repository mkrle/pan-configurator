PAN-PHP-FRAMEWORK
================

PAN-PHP-FRAMEWORK is a PHP library aimed at making PANOS config changes easy (and XML free ;), maintainable and allowing complex scenarios like rule merging, unused object tracking, conversion of checkpoint exclusion groups, massive rule editing, AppID conversion â€¦ to name the ones I do on a regular basis and which are not offered by our GUI. It will work seamlessly on local config file or API.

**Homepage** : download latest sources on [GitHub](https://github.com/swaschkut/pan-configurator). Windows package with PHP binaries here: [dev.zip](https://app.box.com/v/pan-configurator)

**Requirements** : PHP 5.5 with curl module

**Usage**: include the file lib/panos_php_framework.php in your own script to load the necessary classes.

File tree:
* **/lib/** contains library files source code
* **/utils/** contains ready to run scripts, more information in [utils/readme.txt](/utils)
* **/doc/index.html**  has all classes documentations
* **/example-xxx.php** are examples about using this library


With less than 20 lines of code, you should be able to solve most of your needs. Brief overview:

Loading a config from a file :
```php
    $pan = new PANConf();
    $pan->load_from_file('myconfig.xml');
```

Prefer to load it from API candidate config ?
```php
    $connector = panAPIConnector::findOrCreateConnectorFromHost('fw1.mycompany.com');
    $pan = new PANConf();
    $pan->API_load_from_candidate($connector);
```

Delete unused objects from a config :
```php
    foreach($pan->addressStore->addressObjects() as $object )
      if( $object->countReferences() == 0 )
        $pan->addressStore->remove($object);
```

Want to know where an object is used ?
```php
    $object = $pan->addressStore->find('H-WebServer4');
    foreach( $object->getReferences() as $ref )
       print $ref->toString()."\n";
```

Replace that object by another one :
```php
    $object->replaceMeGlobally($anotherObject);
```

Want to add security profile group 'Block-Forward-Critical-High' in rules which have destination zone 'External' and
 source zone 'DMZ'?
```php
    foreach( $vsys1->securityRules->rules() as $rule )
       if( $rule->from->has('DMZ') && $rule->to->has('External') )
           $rule->setSecurityProfileGroup('Block-Forward-Critical-High');
```

Do you hate scripting ? Utility script 'rules-edit.php' is a swiss knife to edit rules and takes advantage of PAN Configurator
 library from a single CLI query, ie :

Do you want to enable log at start for rule going to DMZ zone and that has only object group 'Webfarms' as a destination ?

    rules-edit.php in=api://fw1.mycompany.com actions=logStart-Enable 'filter=(to has dmz) and (dst has.only Webfarms)'

You are not sure about your filter and want to see rules before making changes ? Use action 'display' :

    rules-edit.php  in=api://fw1.mycompany.com actions=display 'filter=(to has dmz) and (dst has.only Webfarms)'

Change all rules using Application + Any service to application default ?

    rules-edit.php in=api://fw1.mycompany.com actions=service-Set-AppDefault 'filter=!(app is.any) and (service is.any)'

Move post-SecurityRules with source zone 'dmz' or source object 'Admin-networks' to pre-Security rule ?

    rules-edit.php  in=api://panorama.mycompany.com actions=invertPreAndPost 'filter=((from has dmz) or (source has Admin-networks) and (rule is.postrule))'

Want to know what actions are supported ?

    rules-edit.php  listActions
    rules-edit.php listFilters
